	      <p>In 2013 Stefan wanted to try out Bitcoin mining and ordered a graphics card to do so. While waiting for his card Stefan developed a script to trade on Cryptsy which was working so well, that when the card came in it was barely breaking even but the script already made 1BTC. At this point Stefan felt this was worth improving and got into contact with Jasper and from that moment on they started to develop an optimized program written in C++ instead of a python script. This became very successful as we passed the 20 BTC mark in late April. In may however we saw a decline in our profits so we started to develop a new algorithm and revamped the whole structure of the software. After a lot of work this started to pay off and the profits started to go up again.</p>

	      <p>We have discussed it several times whether or not to start selling our software but in October 2014 we finally decided to sell, but we both agreed on the fact that we had to do something about the user experience. At that point the program was still running of a config file which had gotten an increasingly complex structure. To solve this we started to develop a GUI which would generate the config file. About 2 months later we put our GUI to the test and asked some of our friends if they wanted to try our program. This lead to long sessions of feedback on how to improve to make easier to configure and which controls and positions best to use. This process is still going on and most likely will never end because their is always something to improve or a new feature to add!</p>
