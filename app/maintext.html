<h1>Welcome to the Tulip Trading Bot WebGUI</h1>

<p>
This tool should help you, to create a configuration file for the Tulip Trading Bot.
The result will be a configuration in a JSON file that you can pass to the Bot by using: tulip-trading-bot -c "config Filename"
    You can also create the JSON file yourself, but preferably use the gui in order to avoid errors.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, configure all the exchanges you wish to use in the <a href="#/exchange">'exchange'</a> tab.
    Depending on which bot you want to use, you might want to add an entry for each exchange you do not have an account for. You can leave the api keys for those blank.
    <br />
    Second, configure bots you wish to use in the <a href="#/bot">'bot'</a> tab.
    <br />
    Third, when you have finished your configuration you can download it in the <a href="#/viewconfig">'viewconfig'</a> tab.
    <br />
    <br />
    We support 2 different bots.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Graph bot.</b> This bot trades on all markets, on a single exchange using arbitrage based tactics. We've made ridiculous amounts of bitcoins with this bot on Cryptsy and Bter in the first half of 2014, but we have yet to finds settings that work in the past few months. It did always work fine on mintpal, we've never really tried it on exchanges other than those three. The profits of this bot depends a lot on how active the altcoin markets are.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Ema bot.</b> This bot trades on one market on single exchange, but does so by inspecting trades on different exchanges. Depending on market conditions, it will either try to go all-in BTC or USD (if you are trading on BTC/USD, that is). This bot has been outperforming 'randomized' trading strategies quite consitently with between 5 and 10% profit each month.
<br />
    Despite the name, the ema bot does actually not use classical ema, and does not have anything to do with ema crossover either. We run the ema bot on around 5 different exchanges to spread risks.
